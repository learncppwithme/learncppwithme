            this is where i'll be keeping a running list of every resource i use throughout my coding journey!

        <tr><td>
            <ol>
            <li><a href="usaco.guide" target=_blank>USACO Guide</a> this resource is the main one i'm using! it's great for practice problems and also gives you an additional list of resources if you're new to the language you're learning (which i am).</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com" target=_blank>Codecademy</a> i started to use this to learn the very basics, like variables, input and output, etc., but i <b>would not recommend</b> because it marks you wrong if your code is not exactly right and a bunch of fun projects and helpful features are locked behind a "Pro" feature. i firmly believe in not paying for any resources, so i won't be using this again.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.learncpp.com/" target=_blank>Learn C++</a> i haven't started to use this yet, but it already seems much more useful than codecademy because it's free and has 23 chapters worth of tutorials!</li>
            </ol><br>
            (and here are some resources i saw recommended multiple times on reddit)
            <ol>
            <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usaco/" target=_blank>USACO subreddit</a> speaking of reddit, is it embarrassing for me to admit i get like 90% of my advice on here? this subreddit is also a great place to find extra resources not included on this list, meet likeminded people, and also motivate you..because some people really just grind algorithms 24/7 and it makes you feel so lazy..</li>
            <li><a href="https://leetcode.com/" target=_blank>leetcode</a> good to practice competitive programming when it's off season or for extra questions. they have weekly contests to participate in so i assume you can level up and get rewards too? might be fun to look into! also i know i lot of cs undergrad majors grind leetcode, so might as well get used to it :p</li>
            <li><a href="https://codeforces.com/" target=_blank>codeforces</a> more challenging competitive programming style questions. besides the USACO guide this is probably the most accurate reprentation of how the contest questions will be like! definitely going to check this one out! (once i get more experience...)</li>
            <li><a href="https://cses.fi/problemset/" target=_blank>CSES problem set</a> this is just a website with a bunch more practice questions. they have topics like strings, trees, dynamic programming, geometry, and more! it's always good to practice as much of these problems as possible.</li>
            </ol>
