            this website is the main one i'm using to get all my information about usaco! it was built by students at
            mit and is actually managed by high school and college students (really accomplished high school students..)
            it also has tons of practice problems that are taken right from previous usaco contests, and even gives you
            a list of additional resources to use for your practicing! so if this list isn't enough for you, make sure
            you check this website out! also, if you're completely new to learning c++ (i was there once, it is very
            frustrating i know) they also provide resources for that! i'm mainly using this website to write my
            <a href="https://daffodil-topaz-64a.notion.site/coding-e56070e587e14402913ceaef57271af4" target=_blank>notion</a>
            notes on all the topics covered in bronze, so make sure you check that (and this website of course) out! i
            basically made a lot of the concepts easier to understand, especially because it can be overwhelming jumping into
            the concepts head first.

            now, i would only reccomend this website for people who are <b>absolute beginners</b>. if you have no idea
            what a variable is, a function, an array, data types, etc., this website is for you. it forces you to practice
            each concept before you move on, and with coding, the only way you're going to retain <em>any</em> information
            is by practicing. a lot. the downsides of codecademy is that they don't really provide many "bigger" practice
            projects for you to do, all of them are behind a paywall. luckily, their c++ course is free though! also, only
            the tutorials are free, the projects and additional practice are not. but if you want to pay, go ahead, i have
            no idea what the quality of the additional stuff is. once you master the basics though, i recommend to go straight
            to another website and start practicing actual competitive-style problems which are set up much differently.

            i actually haven't really used this website extensively yet, only if i was confused about a concept and googling
            brought me to this website. but, if you're more interested in learning c++ as a whole instead of for competitive
            programming, then this is probably your best option! everything is completely free, and it covers all beginner
            concepts that you need. but i don't think it really goes into more advanced concepts? they also provide quizzes
            at the end of each chapter so you can reinforce your learning! just remember if you're only going to use this
            website, please practice the concepts on your own by doing C++ practice problems or projects! they don't have to
            be competitive-style problems, but this is the only way you're going to advance your skills. trust me, i learned
            this the hard way *flashbacks to trying to learn javascript in middle school*

            this is the official subreddit for all things related to USACO, whether it be tips, news, specualtion about the
            concepts, answering common questions. now, don't fall into the trap of comparing yourself to everyone on this
            subreddit, because it's filled with insanely smart coders who have so much experience and practice like 5+ hours
            a day. it's very easy to get discouraged, but don't give up! competitive programming is supposed to be fun and
            challenging. it's only stressful if you make it stressful! i competitively program because it's fun and motivates
            me to learn a new programming language. but if you're more serious, definitely utilize this subreddit as a resource.
            beware though, because 80% of the posts go along the lines of "how long will it take me to reach silver/gold/plat
            in this many months/years". just try to filter those out :p

            good to practice competitive programming when it's off season or for extra questions. of course, the problems
            are the most accurate represenation of usaco problems, but it's always goo to practice algorithmic thinking the
            best you can! they have weekly contests to participate in so i assume you can level up and get rewards too?
            might be fun to look into! also i know i lot of cs undergrad majors grind leetcode, or at least it's a common
            stereotype that i've seen a lot, so might as well get used to it! i personally haven't looked into leetcode yet,
            i have an account though. this is just because i'm focusing on using other resources like usaco guide and
            codeforces, but i might try to do some problems over the summer for after the u.s. open contest (so in april)

            this is just a website with a bunch more practice questions. they have topics like strings, trees, 
            dynamic programming, geometry, and more! it's always good to practice as much of these problems as possible.
            when you practice, try to encounter as many types of algorithms as possible, just in case the contest introduces
            an uncommon one and you aren't 100% lost. a lot of algorithms in bronze aren't that advanced or are pretty
            intuitive, but practice is still important! i haven't used this yet either (are you noticing a pattern?) but i
            saw it recommended on the usaco subreddit and decided to add it! so far i'm just using the usaco guide to
            learn about the different bronze-level algorithms.

            codeforces is probably my favorite resource that i've tried out so far. their practice problems range vastly
            in difficulty, from ratings 800 to 3500, so you can use this reource from bronze all the way up to platinum!
            they also regularly host programming contests, which i highly recommend so you can get used to competiting
            before the actual usaco contests. a lot of the times aren't that convenient though because i'm pretty sure
            they go off of MST (moscow standard time) because the other language option for the website is russian,
            so i assume the creators of the website are based in moscow. so far i haven't been able to compete in a contest
            because of this, but i hope to soon! <a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/kelseym" target=_blank>here's the
            link to my codeforces account!</a> i haven't solved that many problems yet, and most of them are low rated in
            difficultly, but i will definitely have solved more soon!

            i just redid this page, because the previous design was honestly so ugly...i hope you guys like this card
            style layout better! i will try to add more resources if i find them, because they always good to have. but
            honestly you really don't really need that many fancy websites to learn competitive programming. i'm doing fine
            with these limited options (and honestly i haven't even touched some of these websites yet). you don't want to
            get overwhelmed with 50 different resources. if i were to recommend just two websites to use, it would be 
            codeforces and the usaco guide, so i recommend everyone to start with those first! even if you're an absolute
            beginner, the usaco guide has a <a href="https://usaco.guide/general/resources-learning-to-code?lang=cpp" 
            target=_blank>page of resources for people who are just starting to learn how to code.</a> that's all for now,
            happy coding everyone!
