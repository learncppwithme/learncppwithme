    so i have a few updates! sorry it’s been so long since i’ve posted, i’ve been focusing a lot on getting my notes
    page up (as of this post i have two sections fully posted, <b>time complexity</b> and <b>data structures</b>).<br>
    i don’t think i’m going to be studying for the us open anymore, it’s just way too stressful and i’m too busy to 
    really commit to the study schedule (which is like 15 hours a week if i want to move up). of course, i still want
    to be doing competitive programming problems, so i think i’ll continue doing codeforces, and maybe even dip my 
    toe into <a href=”https://leetcode.com/” target=_blank>leetcode</a>? i really want to focus on bettering my 
    website, because i feel like i’ve done so much competitive programming stuff that you guys don’t even know 
    about because it’s not on my website! <em>also i feel like my website is ugly..should i work on a redesign?
    just an idea...</em><br>
    maybe i could do some explanations of past usaco/codeforces problems? i’ll think of some more ideas!<br>

    <em>note: i posted this a little late because i was a little scared of posting anything about the 
    usaco contest while it was still running on monday!</em><br>
    i’m so sad..i did the contest, but as i looked at all the problems, i realized i didn’t understand how to implement
    any of them! i went in so confident too..the problems were so much harder than any ones i’ve ever done before..and
    i really wanted to pass into silver. at least i have another chance in the u.s. open at the end of this month. 
    i’ve decided that now i need a set practice schedule, and i need to also practice problems from the 
    <a href="usaco.guide" target=_blank>usaco guide</a> as well as codeforces problems.  i’ll be partaking in some
    codeforces contests between now and the u.s. open too!<br>
    i redid my <a href="https://github.com/yeslekelsey" target=_blank>github</a>, as you can see i added two new
    repositories, one for usaco problems and one for codeforces problems. i’ll be adding my code for all my
    practice problems there! don’t think i didn’t forget about the notes pages though, that’s coming soon!
    i’ll probably just work on that in class.<br>
    i also set up a practice schedule on notion! but i might just add that to my website too so everything is
    in one place for you guys.<br>
    i hope the usaco contest went better for all of you than it did me..four hours is a long time to stay 
    focused on one thing lol. but i’ll work hard so i can crush the u.s. open! (which is five hours long..great)<br>

    hey guys, i hope you enjoyed the long weekend! (and i really hope you did, because we only get one half day
    off in march rip). the february contest is <b>THIS WEEKEND!!</b> so my top priority is studying and grinding
    practice problems!! i should not have put this off!! my goal isn’t really to pass. moving up to silver would
    be nice, but there’s always the us open if i fail :p<br>
    i just need to learn binary search..and then i’m going to practice as many problems as i can. i practice a lot
    actually! but then i just get demotivated and my brain turns to mush..does anyone have any good practice tips
    i could use? i think i need to set up a set time to practice every day, but it’s hard when i’m so busy..maybe
    i could try to do homework during lunch and using my homework time after school to practice? just for this 
    week though. we’ll see how it turns out. i’ll try to update friday, because it’s kind of been a while since my
    last post oops..<br>
    (p.s. i updated my <a href="resources.html" target=_blank>resources</a> page! i hope it looks good!
    the notes page will have to go on hold until this contest is over i think..sorry guys! i took the message page
    off my website though.)<br>
