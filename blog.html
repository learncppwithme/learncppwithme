      the end of the year is coming up, so this is going to be my final blog post. this website 
      won‚Äôt be updating anymore, mostly because i‚Äôll be way too busy junior year to keep doing it.
      i‚Äôm a little sad to finally be leaving this website, especially because this is the first 
      time i‚Äôve updated a website for almost a year. i can‚Äôt believe my sophomore year is already
      ending, because it feels like just yesterday i was entering high school‚Ä¶how am i going to 
      be an upperclassman next year that‚Äôs so weird to me?<br>
      don‚Äôt worry, i‚Äôm not going to stop programming, because it‚Äôs something i love to do. i don‚Äôt
      know how much time i‚Äôll have to do competitive programming (maybe in the summer i could build
      a few projects?) but i‚Äôm very excited to be learning java next year in ap computer science 
      a! i‚Äôm also helping to update my school‚Äôs website, so my web design knowledge will not go to waste!<br>
      (also, i finished my notes and archive page. don‚Äôt worry, i wasn‚Äôt going to leave my website unfinished!)<br>
      thank you for coming along with me in learning about the wondrous (and slightly frustrating) language 
      C++. i hope you all gained valuable knowledge and passion for problem solving in a competitive environment!<br>
      goodbye,<br>

    hi everyone! i know i said i would have both my notes and archive redesign done by june 1st! and well,
    i did one of those things! as of today, my usaco bronze notes are officially done! thanks to the 
    <a href=‚Äùusaco.guide‚Äù target=_blank>usaco guide</a> website, i was able to really understand the 
    concepts. but i hope my notes are especially helpful to extreme beginners, because i tried to simplify
    the ideas even more (because reading the notes for the first time made me feel extremely overwhelmed..)
    but even if you don‚Äôt understand these notes, i recommend making your own notes. by rewording the 
    usaco guide‚Äôs notes, i was able to study and memorize a lot of the concepts! of course you should 
    practice problems, but taking notes helps too.<br>
    hopefully my archive redesign will be up soon. we‚Äôre coming up on a long weekend so i think i‚Äôm going to do it then!<br>

      hey everyone! just a quick update, i‚Äôm still working on my <a href=archive2.html target=_blank>archive page</a>
      redesign. for some reason the filtering system isn‚Äôt working. i used 
      <a href=‚Äùhttps://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_filter_elements.asp‚Äù target=_blank>code that i found from w3schools</a>
      (which is the same place i found the <a href=‚Äùhttps://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_collapsible.asp‚Äù target=_blank>collapsible</a>
      for my notes page), but it isn‚Äôt letting me filter table elements..i‚Äôll keep testing though!<br>
      the <b>sets and maps</b> notes should be up by friday though, so look forward to that! they‚Äôre going to take
      a little longer than normal because i have to put them on my notion first.<br>
