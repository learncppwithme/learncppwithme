		midterms week…actually my first midterm is on thursday at 8 AM (actually for this class), but the hardest part of 
		midterms is the studying in my opinion.<br>
		i finished the <b>intro to data structures</b> notes on notion! now i’m working on <b>simulation</b>, which  isn’t
		really like programming concepts, but more about how to solve actual competitive programming problems. (but i still
		don’t know why all the sample problems are about cows…) i’m also thinking about replacing the message page with a 
		notes page, of course not as in depth as my other notes but just in case somebody doesn’t have notion, because you
		can’t see them if you don’t have an account. also i feel like a message board is kind of counterintuitive because
		i wouldn’t be getting a lot of messages anyways…<br>
		that might be a project for after midterms though. my next blog post, at the latest, will be friday, but hopefully 
		sooner. if it is friday, my goal is to finish the <b>rectangle geometry</b> topic. (geometry is giving me flashbacks to 
		last year’s math..but i did actually like doing proofs unlike everyone else, it was kind of like programming lol)<br>

		you might be wondering why i'm updating on tuesday instead of monday, but we had a three day weekend! now, next week is midterms, so i don't exactly know
		how much i'll get done these next few weeks because my number one priority is studying for those. but, we do have a lot of half days next week, so maybe i
		can get some study time in? we'll see. i finished my <b>big o notation</b> notes on <a href="https://daffodil-topaz-64a.notion.site/coding-e56070e587e14402913ceaef57271af4" target=_blank>
		notion</a>, and i think i finally fixed the privacy settings so the page isn't private anymore haha, i don't know how i didn't realize before. the <b>intro to data structures</b> is a really big
		topic, so i'm going to try and grind some of that out now. sorry for the short blog post, i've been really busy and kind of stressed because of midterms coming up (because my teachers
		think it's a good idea to cram in a bunch of new stuff right before exams...)<br>
		(p.s. i don't think i'll be ready for the january contest...i don't know how much studying i need to do or if i even have time to study. i'm still going to try though!)<br>

	happy wednesday! between now and friday, i made some updates to <a href="https://daffodil-topaz-64a.notion.site/coding-e56070e587e14402913ceaef57271af4" target=_blank>
	my notion board</a>, where i’ll be putting all my c++ notes that i take down. i know <em>technically</em> i have all the notes
	on the usaco guide anyways, but doing this helps me learn and understand the concepts more and put them into my own words
	(that are often simpler than the terms used on the guide)<br> maybe i’m just slow, but a lot of times coding resources
	use overly complicated terms that are not beginner friendly, and honestly hard to read if you’re tired (because i do a
	lot of my work in the morning during school). i hope that by using my notes, you can also understand the concepts more!
	i’m currently writing the <b>time complexity</b> topic, and next i will move on to the <b>intro to data structures</b> notes (and those
	will probably take a couple days haha). that's all for now! (p.s. i tried to do a few practice problems but i didn’t
	understand any of them? i don’t know what to do…i guess just more practicing)<br>
