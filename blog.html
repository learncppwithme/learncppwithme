    happy new year! i had a great winter break, even though i didn’t really do anything productive related to this project, it’s good to take a break sometimes, right? now that we’re in a new year, i’m trying to get a little more ambitious with this website, which means i will officially start practicing competition style problems. i don’t know if i’ll need to use the practice method i saw on reddit (referring to my last post), because it’s pretty intense and midterms are coming up in a couple of weeks..
	it’s honestly really annoying how the january contests lines up so perfectly with midterms, how will i do both? i think as a beginner i will start looking at the usaco practice problems this week and then some codeforces problems? i’ll practice a little tonight and this week, expect a blog post by friday! (i should probably post more often considering now i’m getting into actual competitive programming instead of just learning cpp syntax) okay, that’s all i have to say, nothing much new because of winter break!<br>

	hi again. sorry it's been so long. from now on i think i'll try to update every two weeks. but maybe i'll update again
	next week because winter break is coming up. while i've been gone, i switched my website over to github (a different account,
	i'll still be posting projects and stuff to my main, not school related account) and learned functions and loops! i'm trying to
	breeze through the very basics pretty quickly so i can get to practicing some actual competitive programming style questions,
	because they are formatted much differently than normal coding challenges. according to the <a href="https://usaco.guide/general/expected-knowledge?lang=cpp" target=_blank>usaco guide</a>
	website, all i need to do now is learn multidimensional arrays, and then i can start solving actual problems! i'm excited but 
	also kind of scared, because i looked at a competitive programming problem a couple months ago and it looked really complicated..<br>
	but i plan to use this practice method i found on reddit, i can link it <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usaco/comments/pk3tjp/the_ultimate_usaco_practice_method/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf"  target=_blank>here</a>. i'm going to try and practice a lot over winter break, and if everything goes according to plan, 
	i will be participating in the <b>january contest!!</b> that's all for now, see you next week!<br>

	hi guys! sorry this update is a little bit later than promised, things have been a little busy
    with getting everything else up, and honestly i had a pretty unproductive thanksgiving break...
    i tried looking up early 2000s emojis, like the ones in old chat boxes and stuff, but i couldn't
    find anything, and i refuse to use regular emojis because i want it to look the same across all
    devices. :( i'll keep looking though!
    on a more positive note, i updated my github a little, with two new projects i did over the break!
    i guess i wasn't 100% unproductive, maybe i'm too hard on myself. the first one is a simple converter
    that i made a while ago, and the second one i just made over the weekend, that tests whether a year inputed
    is a leap year! honestly pretty boring stuff, these were just sample projects on codecademy (not the best
    resource but good for project inspo, especially at the beginner level i'm at) basically what i was
    practicing was if else and declaring variables! my next goal is loops (and i'm kind of scared because
    i sturggled with those in python...)
    before i say goodbye, make sure to check out my github and my daily practice schedule, which should be
    up soon!<br>
