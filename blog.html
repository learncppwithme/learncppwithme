    i think this is the closest in time any of my two blog posts have ever been. if you’re paying attention
    to the rest of my blog page, i added a countdown to the february contest, pretty cool, right? it’s honestly 
    just code that i modified from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_countdown.asp" target=_blank>w3schools</a>,
    because i don’t know really any javascript (which i probably should learn because that’s what you use with html websites),
    but learning one language at a time is enough. anyways, hopefully i can stay motivated by seeing the timer counting down
    every time i look at my website.<br>
    i started my <b>rectangle geometry</b> notes, and i also moved on to another practice problem, because the solution for
    my last one needed logarithms and i haven’t learned that yet..so maybe i should watch a khan academy video on them
    or something? i also realized that just starting at one problem wasn’t going to help me.<br>
    i’m thinking of signing up for a free workshop tomorrow that i found on the <a href="http://usaco.guide" target=_blank>usaco guide</a>!
    <a href="https://joincpi.org/workshops/jan23" target=_blank>here’s the link for it</a> if you’re also interested. 
    they’re going over the bronze and silver solutions to the workshop, and i figured that even if i don’t
    know anything or am really lost, i won’t regret attending.<br>
    so my weekend goals are to finish the rectangle geometry notes, attend the usaco guide workshop, start drafting a notes page on
    my website and work on practice problems..(i was also thinking that maybe watching other people solve problems on youtube might
    help me learn how to approach the problems better, so i’ll look for that too!)<br>

      sorry, i know i said i would update on friday, but i got really distracted because of midterms and i forgot that
      i even said i would update! i didn’t really get any work done in the time between that, but i attempted a <b>simulation</b>
      problem, and i thought i solved it but the code isn’t working :( . however, the link to the problem i attempted is
      <a href="http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=735" target=_blank>here</a> and my code for it is 
      <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ihPlfQMvB8honnc7iX2INxc5bU7mvPM0/view?usp=sharing" target=_blank>here</a>!
      if you want to see it. i’ll post the code to my github once it’s actually working..i know everyone says if you dont
      get the problem to just look up the answer and move on, but i want to try and solve at least one before i move on.<br>
      and then once it works, i will update my github and move on to my <b>rectangle geometry</b> notes! and then i will get
      to grinding problems to prepare for the <b><em>FEBRUARY CONTEST!!!**</b></em> now that midterms are over, school will
      be not that hard for about a month i think, because hopefully they will not be pushing so much content on us. i know i
      said i was trying to participate in the january contest, but honestly the timing of that was really inconvenient. i will
      try to update on friday and work on my notes page (the one on my website i mentioned last post) over the weekend!<br>

      midterms week…actually my first midterm is on thursday at 8 AM (for this class), but the hardest part of 
      midterms is the studying in my opinion.<br>
      i finished the <b>intro to data structures</b> notes on notion! now i’m working on <b>simulation</b>, which  isn’t
      really like programming concepts, but more about how to solve actual competitive programming problems. (but i still
      don’t know why all the sample problems are about cows…) i’m also thinking about replacing the message page with a 
      notes page, of course not as in depth as my other notes but just in case somebody doesn’t have notion, because you
      can’t see them if you don’t have an account. also i feel like a message board is kind of counterintuitive because
      i wouldn’t be getting a lot of messages anyways…<br>
      that might be a project for after midterms though. my next blog post, at the latest, will be friday, but hopefully 
      sooner. if it is friday, my goal is to finish the <b>rectangle geometry</b> topic. (geometry is giving me flashbacks to 
      last year’s math..but i did actually like doing proofs unlike everyone else, it was kind of like programming lol)<br></tr>
