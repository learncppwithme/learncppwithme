    hey guys, i hope you enjoyed the long weekend! (and i really hope you did, because we only get one half day
    off in march rip). the february contest is <b>THIS WEEKEND!!</b> so my top priority is studying and grinding
    practice problems!! i should not have put this off!! my goal isn’t really to pass. moving up to silver would
    be nice, but there’s always the us open if i fail :p<br>
    i just need to learn binary search..and then i’m going to practice as many problems as i can. i practice a lot
    actually! but then i just get demotivated and my brain turns to mush..does anyone have any good practice tips
    i could use? i think i need to set up a set time to practice every day, but it’s hard when i’m so busy..maybe
    i could try to do homework during lunch and using my homework time after school to practice? just for this 
    week though. we’ll see how it turns out. i’ll try to update friday, because it’s kind of been a while since my
    last post oops..<br>
    (p.s. i updated my <a href="resources.html" target=_blank>resources</a> page! i hope it looks good!
    the notes page will have to go on hold until this contest is over i think..sorry guys! i took the message page
    off my website though.)<br>

    happy valentine’s day! i normally would do a blog post a day earlier, but i’m trying to increase the frequency
    of my blog posts, especially because of how long my blog post was last time. i’m trying out more 
    <a href="https://codeforces.com/?locale=en" target=_blank>codeforces</a> problems, and i’m even trying out how
    to do a <b>rectangular geometry</b> problem. (the problem is marked as “very easy” but i keep getting the wrong
    answer…) i feel like the reason why i don’t understand how to do a lot of the problems is because i haven’t 
    learned about a lot of the concepts yet, so i’m going to keep doing my 
    <a href="https://daffodil-topaz-64a.notion.site/coding-e56070e587e14402913ceaef57271af4" target=_blank>notion</a>
    notes! during class time i will work on my website/notion, and outside of class i’ll keep doing practice problems!<br>
    also, if i have time this week i will try to get my notes page up, but if not i will over the weekend! see you later!<br>

    i have a lot to update on! that's why this post is so long..i probably should have made a separate post earlier
		on this week, because i did <em>a lot</em> of stuff over the weekend, but honestly i haven't been doing that much
		this week, i must be in a post midterm slump or something..<br>
		but i feel like i’m making a lot of progress in practice problems! i’m feeling much more optimistic because
		instead of feeling 100% lost, i only feel about 50% lost now! i started practicing on <a href="https://codeforces.com/?locale=en" target=_blank>codeforces</a>,
		(<a href="https://codeforces.com/profile/kelseym?locale=en" target=_blank>here’s</a> the link to my account)
		it’s kind of like a website where you can practice a bunch of competitive-style problems (seriously, they have
		so many!) and participate in contests! there was actually a contest today, but it was from 2:30 to 4:30 so i 
		couldn’t make it :( but i’m going to try and make it to the next one if it’s at a better time! i basically 
		sorted the problems from easiest to hardest (and the first problem i did was actually so easy that i finished
		it in 2 minutes..). those easy problems were really an ego boost for me and i think practicing them made me
		better at problem solving if that makes sense..they’re also really fun! i started to work on this problem,
		<a href="http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=665" target=_blank>the cow signal</a>, and
		it’s a lot easier than i remembered..still pretty challenging though because i’ve been trying to solve it
		for the past few class periods, but i’m definitely getting close!<br>
		i also updated my <a href="https://github.com/yeslekelsey" target=_blank>github</a> with the code from the
		codeforces problems that passed all test cases, and plan to add a bunch more! (my profile is also really fancy
		now, i hope you appreciate my design choices)<br>
		so far i’m only doing problems ranked 800 (the lowest difficulty haha) but i plan to try more advanced ones,
		like 900 and 1000, tomorrow and over the weekend! honestly now that i sort of know what i’m doing, solving
		problems like this is more fun and challenging rather than frustrating. i will try to update again on monday,
		because i plan to have done at least five more problems by then, (increasing my difficulty) and hopefully have
		the code ready for the cow signal!! see you then!<br>
		<em>(p.s., i attended the workshop, but i don’t really feel like it was useful? it was just taught by kids my
		age who have been coding since they came out of the womb and are probably auto-admits to mit..seriously, how
		do you start a nonprofit at 13? yes i did stalk their githubs…)</em><br>
