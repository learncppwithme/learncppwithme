		sorry, i know i said i would update on friday, but i got really distracted because of midterms and i forgot that
		i even said i would update! i didn’t really get any work done in the time between that, but i attempted a <b>simulation</b>
		problem, and i thought i solved it but the code isn’t working :( . however, the link to the problem i attempted is
		<a href="http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=735" target=_blank>here</a> and my code for it is 
		<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ihPlfQMvB8honnc7iX2INxc5bU7mvPM0/view?usp=sharing" target=_blank>here</a>!
		if you want to see it. i’ll post the code to my github once it’s actually working..i know everyone says if you dont
		get the problem to just look up the answer and move on, but i want to try and solve at least one before i move on.<br>
		and then once it works, i will update my github and move on to my <b>rectangle geometry</b> notes! and then i will get
		to grinding problems to prepare for the <b><em>FEBRUARY CONTEST!!!**</b></em> now that midterms are over, school will
		be not that hard for about a month i think, because hopefully they will not be pushing so much content on us. i know i
		said i was trying to participate in the january contest, but honestly the timing of that was really inconvenient. i will
		try to update on friday and work on my notes page (the one on my website i mentioned last post) over the weekend!<br>

		midterms week…actually my first midterm is on thursday at 8 AM (for this class), but the hardest part of 
		midterms is the studying in my opinion.<br>
		i finished the <b>intro to data structures</b> notes on notion! now i’m working on <b>simulation</b>, which  isn’t
		really like programming concepts, but more about how to solve actual competitive programming problems. (but i still
		don’t know why all the sample problems are about cows…) i’m also thinking about replacing the message page with a 
		notes page, of course not as in depth as my other notes but just in case somebody doesn’t have notion, because you
		can’t see them if you don’t have an account. also i feel like a message board is kind of counterintuitive because
		i wouldn’t be getting a lot of messages anyways…<br>
		that might be a project for after midterms though. my next blog post, at the latest, will be friday, but hopefully 
		sooner. if it is friday, my goal is to finish the <b>rectangle geometry</b> topic. (geometry is giving me flashbacks to 
		last year’s math..but i did actually like doing proofs unlike everyone else, it was kind of like programming lol)<br></tr>

		you might be wondering why i'm updating on tuesday instead of monday, but we had a three day weekend! now, next week is midterms, so i don't exactly know
		how much i'll get done these next few weeks because my number one priority is studying for those. but, we do have a lot of half days next week, so maybe i
		can get some study time in? we'll see. i finished my <b>big o notation</b> notes on <a href="https://daffodil-topaz-64a.notion.site/coding-e56070e587e14402913ceaef57271af4" target=_blank>
		notion</a>, and i think i finally fixed the privacy settings so the page isn't private anymore haha, i don't know how i didn't realize before. the <b>intro to data structures</b> is a really big
		topic, so i'm going to try and grind some of that out now. sorry for the short blog post, i've been really busy and kind of stressed because of midterms coming up (because my teachers
		think it's a good idea to cram in a bunch of new stuff right before exams...)<br>
		(p.s. i don't think i'll be ready for the january contest...i don't know how much studying i need to do or if i even have time to study. i'm still going to try though!)<br>
