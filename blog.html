		happy wednesday! between now and friday, i made some updates to <a href="https://www.notion.so/coding-e56070e587e14402913ceaef57271af4" target=_blank>
		my notion board</a>, where i’ll be putting all my c++ notes that i take down. i know <em>technically<em> i have all the notes
		on the usaco guide anyways, but doing this helps me learn and understand the concepts more and put them into my own words
		(that are often simpler than the terms used on the guide)<br> maybe i’m just slow, but a lot of times coding resources
		use overly complicated terms that are not beginner friendly, and honestly hard to read if you’re tired (because i do a
		lot of my work in the morning during school). i hope that by using my notes, you can also understand the concepts more!
		i’m currently writing the <b>time complexity</b> topic, and next i will move on to the <b>intro to data structures</b> notes (and those
		will probably take a couple days haha). that's all for now! (p.s. i tried to do a few practice problems but i didn’t
		understand any of them? i don’t know what to do…i guess just more practicing)<br>

	hello again! i promised to post by friday, sorry i’m a whole day late. i was a little preoccupied yesterday because i decided
    to teach myself how to crochet…not an excuse but i don’t care i love crocheting it was worth it!!! the blog posts should 
    become more frequent as i keep learning harder stuff, so maybe expect another in the beginning of the week? i don’t know if
    i’ll practice anything today but i will try tomorrow (sunday), monday, and tuesday.<br>
    i started reading the <a href="https://usaco.guide/bronze" target=_blank>usaco guide bronze section</a> to learn more about common topics. so far i’ve read some parts of<em>Time Complexity</em>
    which includes <em>Into to Big O Notation</em> and <em>Intro to Data Structures</em>. <b>big o notation</b> is basically the bounds for how
    complex an algorithm is in the worst case scenario. it’s useful because in a contest where there’s a time limit for how long your program
    can take to run. (two seconds for cpp programs) at first i didn’t understand anything about this, but watching the corresponding youtube
    video helped me a lot. honestly, it’s probably better to only understand about 50% of the topic right now, and then i’ll learn more once
    i actually encounter practice problems where i’ll need to use big o notation. in the <b>intro to data structures</b>, a lot of the section
    was review, like <b>vectors</b> which i learned on codecademy, but something new was <b>dynamic arrays</b>, which are similar to normal
    arrays but can resize themselves by adding and deleting elements. i also learned about <b>iterators</b>, which point to specific objects in a container.
    who knew there were so many topics covered in bronze? isn’t this supposed to be the easiest level…did i get as much done as i wanted to?
    no not really, but it’s a start! and i started learning actual competitive programming topics which is great! goodbye for now!<br>

	happy new year! i had a great winter break, even though i didn’t really do anything productive related to this project,
    it’s good to take a break sometimes, right? now that we’re in a new year, i’m trying to get a little more ambitious with
    this website, which means i will officially start practicing competition style problems. i don’t know if i’ll need to use
    the practice method i saw on reddit (referring to my last post), because it’s pretty intense and midterms are coming up
    in a couple of weeks..<br>
    it’s honestly really annoying how the january contests lines up so perfectly with midterms, how will i do both? i think
    as a beginner i will start looking at the usaco practice problems this week and then some codeforces problems? i’ll 
    practice a little tonight and this week, expect a blog post by friday! (i should probably post more often considering
    now i’m getting into actual competitive programming instead of just learning cpp syntax) okay, that’s all i have to say,
    nothing much new because of winter break!<br>
