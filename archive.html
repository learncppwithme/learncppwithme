			on this website, i will be updating my process of learning c++ throughout the 2022-2023 school year. my ultimate goal 
			is to get usaco gold rank, but that is a more long term goal that i would probably achieve next school year. i will be 
			posting the resources i use to aid my learning, practice problems, c++ projects i complete, and more. the first usaco
			contest is in December, so i honestly don't know yet if i will compete in it considering it's so soon and i only really
			know the very basics of c++, like variables, output and input, and if/else. i also know some python too, but people don't
			recommend using that language for competitive programming as it's slower than c++. i'm also not choosing to learn java
			because i plan to learn it next year in apcsa. (and of course, knowing c++ and java is more useful than knowing just java)<br><br>
			<em>11/28/2022</em><br>
			hi guys! sorry this update is a little bit later than promised, things have been a little busy with getting everything 
			else up, and honestly i had a pretty unproductive thanksgiving break... i tried looking up early 2000s emojis, like the
			ones in old chat boxes and stuff, but i couldn't find anything, and i refuse to use regular emojis because i want it to
			look the same across all devices. :( i'll keep looking though! on a more positive note, i updated my github a little, 
			with two new projects i did over the break! i guess i wasn't 100% unproductive, maybe i'm too hard on myself. the first
			one is a simple converter that i made a while ago, and the second one i just made over the weekend, that tests whether 
			a year inputed is a leap year! honestly pretty boring stuff, these were just sample projects on codecademy (not the best
			resource but good for project inspo, especially at the beginner level i'm at) basically what i was practicing was if else
			and declaring variables! my next goal is loops (and i'm kind of scared because i sturggled with those in python...) before
			i say goodbye, make sure to check out my github and my daily practice schedule, which should be up soon!<br><br>
			<em>12/15/2022</em><br>
			hi again. sorry it's been so long. from now on i think i'll try to update every two weeks. but maybe i'll update again
			next week because winter break is coming up. while i've been gone, i switched my website over to github (a different account,
			i'll still be posting projects and stuff to my main, not school related account) and learned functions and loops! i'm trying to
			breeze through the very basics pretty quickly so i can get to practicing some actual competitive programming style questions,
			because they are formatted much differently than normal coding challenges. according to the <a href="https://usaco.guide/general/expected-knowledge?lang=cpp" target=_blank>usaco guide</a>
			website, all i need to do now is learn multidimensional arrays, and then i can start solving actual problems! i'm excited but 
			also kind of scared, because i looked at a competitive programming problem a couple months ago and it looked really complicated..<br>
			but i plan to use this practice method i found on reddit, i can link it <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usaco/comments/pk3tjp/the_ultimate_usaco_practice_method/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf"target=_blank>here</a>. i'm going to try and practice a lot over winter break, and if everything goes according to plan, 
			i will be participating in the <b>january contest!!</b> that's all for now, see you next week!<br><br>
			<em>1/3/2023</em><br>
			happy new year! i had a great winter break, even though i didn’t really do anything productive related to this project,
			it’s good to take a break sometimes, right? now that we’re in a new year, i’m trying to get a little more ambitious with
			this website, which means i will officially start practicing competition style problems. i don’t know if i’ll need to 
			use the practice method i saw on reddit (referring to my last post), because it’s pretty intense and midterms are coming
			up in a couple of weeks..<br>
			it’s honestly really annoying how the january contests lines up so perfectly with midterms, how will i do both? i think
			as a beginner i will start looking at the usaco practice problems this week and then some codeforces problems? i’ll 
			practice a little tonight and this week, expect a blog post by friday! (i should probably post more often considering
			now i’m getting into actual competitive programming instead of just learning cpp syntax) okay, that’s all i have to say,
			nothing much new because of winter break!<br><br>

			happy wednesday! between now and friday, i made some updates to <a href="https://daffodil-topaz-64a.notion.site/coding-e56070e587e14402913ceaef57271af4" target=_blank>
			my notion board</a>, where i’ll be putting all my c++ notes that i take down. i know <em>technically<em> i have all the notes
			on the usaco guide anyways, but doing this helps me learn and understand the concepts more and put them into my own words
			(that are often simpler than the terms used on the guide)<br> maybe i’m just slow, but a lot of times coding resources
			use overly complicated terms that are not beginner friendly, and honestly hard to read if you’re tired (because i do a
			lot of my work in the morning during school). i hope that by using my notes, you can also understand the concepts more!
			i’m currently writing the <b>time complexity</b> topic, and next i will move on to the <b>intro to data structures</b> notes (and those
			will probably take a couple days haha). that's all for now! (p.s. i tried to do a few practice problems but i didn’t
			understand any of them? i don’t know what to do…i guess just more practicing)<br><br>
			<em>1/17/2023</em><br>
			you might be wondering why i'm updating on tuesday instead of monday, but we had a three day weekend! now, next week is midterms, so i don't exactly know
			how much i'll get done these next few weeks because my number one priority is studying for those. but, we do have a lot of half days next week, so maybe i
			can get some study time in? we'll see. i finished my <b>big o notation</b> notes on <a href="https://daffodil-topaz-64a.notion.site/coding-e56070e587e14402913ceaef57271af4" target=_blank>
			notion</a>, and i think i finally fixed the privacy settings so the page isn't private anymore haha, i don't know how i didn't realize before. the <b>intro to data structures</b> is a really big
			topic, so i'm going to try and grind some of that out now. sorry for the short blog post, i've been really busy and kind of stressed because of midterms coming up (because my teachers
			think it's a good idea to cram in a bunch of new stuff right before exams...)<br>
			(p.s. i don't think i'll be ready for the january contest...i don't know how much studying i need to do or if i even have time to study. i'm still going to try though!)<br><br>
			<em>1/23/2023</em><br>
			midterms week…actually my first midterm is on thursday at 8 AM (actually for this class), but the hardest part of 
			midterms is the studying in my opinion.<br>
			i finished the <b>intro to data structures</b> notes on notion! now i’m working on <b>simulation</b>, which  isn’t
			really like programming concepts, but more about how to solve actual competitive programming problems. (but i still
			don’t know why all the sample problems are about cows…) i’m also thinking about replacing the message page with a 
			notes page, of course not as in depth as my other notes but just in case somebody doesn’t have notion, because you
			can’t see them if you don’t have an account. also i feel like a message board is kind of counterintuitive because
			i wouldn’t be getting a lot of messages anyways…<br>
			that might be a project for after midterms though. my next blog post, at the latest, will be friday, but hopefully 
			sooner. if it is friday, my goal is to finish the <b>rectangle geometry</b> topic. (geometry is giving me flashbacks to 
			last year’s math..but i did actually like doing proofs unlike everyone else, it was kind of like programming lol)<br><br>
			<em>2/1/2023</em><br>
			sorry, i know i said i would update on friday, but i got really distracted because of midterms and i forgot that
			i even said i would update! i didn’t really get any work done in the time between that, but i attempted a <b>simulation</b>
			problem, and i thought i solved it but the code isn’t working :( . however, the link to the problem i attempted is
			<a href="http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=735" target=_blank>here</a> and my code for it is 
			<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ihPlfQMvB8honnc7iX2INxc5bU7mvPM0/view?usp=sharing" target=_blank>here</a>!
			if you want to see it. i’ll post the code to my github once it’s actually working..i know everyone says if you dont
			get the problem to just look up the answer and move on, but i want to try and solve at least one before i move on.<br>
			and then once it works, i will update my github and move on to my <b>rectangle geometry</b> notes! and then i will get
			to grinding problems to prepare for the <b><em>FEBRUARY CONTEST!!!**</b></em> now that midterms are over, school will
			be not that hard for about a month i think, because hopefully they will not be pushing so much content on us. i know i
			said i was trying to participate in the january contest, but honestly the timing of that was really inconvenient. i will
			try to update on friday and work on my notes page (the one on my website i mentioned last post) over the weekend!<br><br>
			<em>2/3/2023</em><br>
			i think this is the closest in time any of my two blog posts have ever been. if you’re paying attention
			to the rest of my blog page, i added a countdown to the february contest, pretty cool, right? it’s honestly 
			just code that i modified from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_countdown.asp" target=_blank>w3schools</a>,
			because i don’t know really any javascript (which i probably should learn because that’s what you use with html websites),
			but learning one language at a time is enough. anyways, hopefully i can stay motivated by seeing the timer counting down
			every time i look at my website.<br>
			i started my <b>rectangle geometry</b> notes, and i also moved on to another practice problem, because the solution for
			my last one needed logarithms and i haven’t learned that yet..so maybe i should watch a khan academy video on them
			or something? i also realized that just starting at one problem wasn’t going to help me.<br>
			i’m thinking of signing up for a free workshop tomorrow that i found on the <a href="http://usaco.guide" target=_blank>usaco guide</a>!
			<a href="https://joincpi.org/workshops/jan23" target=_blank>here’s the link for it</a> if you’re also interested. 
			they’re going over the bronze and silver solutions to the workshop, and i figured that even if i don’t
			know anything or am really lost, i won’t regret attending.<br>
			so my weekend goals are to finish the rectangle geometry notes, attend the usaco guide workshop, start drafting a notes page on
			my website and work on practice problems..(i was also thinking that maybe watching other people solve problems on youtube might
			help me learn how to approach the problems better, so i’ll look for that too!)<br><br>
