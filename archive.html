			on this website, i will be updating my process of learning c++ throughout the 2022-2023 school year. my ultimate goal is to get usaco gold rank, but that is a more longterm goal that i would probably achieve next school year. i will be posting the resources i use to aid my learning, practice problems, c++ projects i complete, and more. the first usaco contest is in December, so i honestly don't know yet if i will compete in it considering it's so soon and i only really know the very basics of c++, like variables, output and input, and if/else. i also know some python too, but people don't reccomend using that language for competitive programming as it's slower than c++. i'm also not choosing to learn java becase i plan to learn it next year in apcsa. (and of course, knowing c++ and java is more useful than knowing just java)<br>

			hi guys! sorry this update is a little bit later than promised, things have been a little busy with getting everything else up, and honestly i had a pretty unproductive thanksgiving break... i tried looking up early 2000s emojis, like the ones in old chat boxes and stuff, but i couldn't find anything, and i refuse to use regular emojis because i want it to look the same across all devices. :( i'll keep looking though! on a more positive note, i updated my github a little, with two new projects i did over the break! i guess i wasn't 100% unproductive, maybe i'm too hard on myself. the first one is a simple converter that i made a while ago, and the second one i just made over the weekend, that tests whether a year inputed is a leap year! honestly pretty boring stuff, these were just sample projects on codecademy (not the best resource but good for project inspo, especially at the beginner level i'm at) basically what i was practicing was if else and declaring variables! my next goal is loops (and i'm kind of scared because i sturggled with those in python...) before i say goodbye, make sure to check out my github and my daily practice schedule, which should be up soon!<br>

			hi again. sorry it's been so long. from now on i think i'll try to update every two weeks. but maybe i'll update again
			next week because winter break is coming up. while i've been gone, i switched my website over to github (a different account,
			i'll still be posting porjects and stuff to my main, not school related account) and learned functions and loops! i'm trying to
			breeze through the very basics pretty quickly so i can get to practicing some actual competitive programming style questions,
			because they are formatted much differently than normal coding challenges. according to the <a href="https://usaco.guide/general/expected-knowledge?lang=cpp" target=_blank>usaco guide</a>
			website, all i need to do now is learn multidimensional arrays, and then i can start solving actual problems! i'm excited but 
			also kind of scared, because i looked at a competitive programming problem a couple months ago and it looked really complicated..<br>
			but i plan to use this practice method i found on reddit, i can link it <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/usaco/comments/pk3tjp/the_ultimate_usaco_practice_method/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf"target=_blank>here</a>. i'm going to try and practice a lot over winter break, and if everything goes according to plan, 
			i will be participating in the <b>january contest!!</b> that's all for now, see you next week!<br>
